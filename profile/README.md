# CSUN ARCS

The [California State University, Northridge (CSUN)](https://www.csun.edu) [Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM (ARCS)](https://arcs.center) is a NASA-launched university center of excellence combining the talents of faculty and students from 6 CSUN colleges and forging research collaborations between physical, social, and behavioral science (S); technology and engineering (T); entrepreneurship and business (E); arts (A); humanities (H); and mathematics (M). ARCS’ vision is to be a global leader in education, research and commercialization regarding increasingly autonomous (IA) systems. To achieve its vision, ARCS is pioneering at CSUN the implementation of a Convergence Research model (one of the National Science Foundation’s 10 Big Ideas).

## CoHORT Project

The [CoHORT (Cooperative Human Operations with Robot Teams) project](https://arcs.center/cohort-cooperative-human-operations-with-robot-teams/) is a collaborative effort between researchers at CSUN ARCS and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It was proposed as a follow-on to JPL's [CADRE (Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration) mission](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre/), with the goal of adapting its hardware and software designs for academic research. In CADRE, several small rovers were developed from prototypes to flight models and will be deployed to the Moon’s Reiner Gamma region as part of a multi-robot autonomy technology demonstration. These rovers will work as a team to explore the surface autonomously, map the subsurface in 3D, and collect distributed measurements -- demonstrating the potential of future multi-robot missions. CoHORT builds on the Mercury 7 CADRE prototypes by reengineering the rover platform for research use, including updates to the mechanical design, compute hardware, and autonomy stack, which replaces the flight-oriented F Prime framework with a novel ROS 2-based architecture.
